## 1. Vision & Goal
To facilitate an "AI-driven Engineering Education" by empowering faculty at institutions like Sairam to adopt AI into their core work pillars of Teaching, Administration, and Research. The goal is to build a durable, daily habit of using AI to drive productivity and innovation.

## 2. Business Model
* **Offering:** A 21-day, in-person, mobile-first Faculty Development Program (FDP), preceded by a 90-minute "Ignition Session".
* **Price Point:** 10 Lakh INR per institutional contract.
* **Long-Term Goal:** Build a loyal community of "Teacher Followers" and provide continued support via a "Community Template Store".

## 3. Core Principles & Architecture
* **Mobile-Only App:** The primary LMS app for onboarding, management, and community features is designed exclusively for smartphones.
* **WhatsApp-First Interaction:** While the app is the 'command center', the primary channel for daily user interaction with AI agents will be WhatsApp, ensuring maximum engagement and ease of use.
* **Frictionless Authentication:** User login and registration will be handled via a simple Mobile Number + OTP process.
* **Hyper-Personalized Curriculum:** The bootcamp content is tailored based on real-world tasks collected from participants during the pre-bootcamp session.

## 4. Target Audience
* **Primary Market:** College Faculty Development Programs (FDPs).
* **Initial Client Profile:** Sairam Institutions, Tambaram, Chennai (Engineering & Technology focus).

## 5. User Journey & Program Structure

### 5.1. Module -1: The Pre-Bootcamp "Ignition Session" (90 Mins)
* **Objective:** To generate excitement and crowdsource the real, day-to-day tasks of the attendees for hyper-personalization.
* **Key Activities:** A high-energy session involving a "Wow" demo, an interactive sticky-note workshop to map user pains, and live problem-solving using AI.

### 5.2. Onboarding: In-App & WhatsApp
1.  **App Registration:** User registers in the mobile app using their mobile number and receives an OTP to log in.
2.  **AI Aptitude Test:** User completes a ~10-minute, hands-on assessment within the app to determine their starting Track.
3.  **Cohort Reveal:** A celebratory in-app screen reveals their cohort "badge" (e.g., "AI-Adopter") and mission.
4.  **WhatsApp Initiation:** Upon successful registration, the LMS automatically sends a welcome message to the user's WhatsApp, establishing the communication channel.

### 5.3. The 21-Day Program: Pacing & Rhythm
The daily commitment is 1-2 hours. The pacing adapts to the user's track, ensuring a balance of challenge and achievement.

| Track | Typical Task Mix | Implication for Daily Pacing (1-2 hr session) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. AI-Curious** | 90% Quick Wins | Can complete **2-3 tasks per day**. |
| **2. AI-Explorer** | 50% Quick Wins, 50% Standard Tasks | Can complete **1-2 tasks per day**. |
| **3. AI-Adopter**| 70% Standard Tasks, 30% Project Tasks | Will likely focus on **one significant task per day**. |
| **4. AI-Innovator** | 80% Project Tasks, 20% Standard Tasks | Will focus on **one major project task per day**. |
| **5. AI-Catalyst**| 40% Standard Tasks, 60% Project Tasks | Will focus on **one strategic task per day**. |

### 5.4. Curriculum: 5 Tracks & 15 Modules
*(The full curriculum consists of 150 unique, mobile-first tasks detailed in a separate document. The modules are listed below.)*
